## Getting Started

1. Open the project in Xcode 15+
2. Configure signing and capabilities
3. Copy `Config.plist.example` to `Config.plist` and add your API keys, **or** create a `.env` file with the same keys.
4. Build and run on iOS 16+ device or simulator

## Running Tests

Run all unit and UI tests using Xcode:

```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme SnapEditAI-Package -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14,OS=16.4'
```

Or open the project in Xcode and press **Cmd+U** to execute the test suite.

## API Integration

### Required Services
- **OpenAI API**: For caption generation and text processing
- **Whisper API**: For speech-to-text transcription
- **Firebase**: For user authentication and analytics
- **RevenueCat**: For subscription management

### Configuration

API credentials are never committed to the repository. The app reads values from `Config.plist`, an optional `.env` file, or environment variables in that order.

1. Copy `Config.plist.example` to `Config.plist` and supply your own values, **or**
2. Create a `.env` file (also ignored by git) with the following keys.

Required keys:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `WHISPER_API_KEY`
- `FIREBASE_CONFIG`
- `REVENUECAT_KEY`

For Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics:

1. Create a Firebase project and enable Analytics and Crashlytics.
2. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` from the Firebase console and add it to the Xcode project.
3. Ensure Crashlytics run scripts are configured when archiving releases.


## Target Market

- **Primary**: Gen Z content creators (16-24 years)
- **Secondary**: Micro-influencers and small businesses
- **Use Cases**: TikTok videos, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, podcast clips

## Competitive Advantage

1. **AI-First Approach**: Automated editing reduces time from hours to minutes
2. **Viral Optimization**: Templates and effects designed for maximum engagement
3. **Mobile-Native**: Optimized for smartphone content creation workflow
4. **Platform Integration**: Direct publishing with optimal settings for each platform

## Revenue Projections

- **Year 1**: 100,000 active users, 8% conversion rate
- **Monthly Revenue**: $40,000 (8,000 paid users Ã— $5)
- **Year 2**: $1M ARR with viral growth and feature expansion

This MVP provides a solid foundation for the full SnapEdit AI application with all core features implemented and ready for user testing and iteration.
